## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge of the Stats Preview Card Compoent was to create a mobile and desktop hero section with a title, description, stats, and an image. There was no functionality to the challenge, only a responsive design between desktop and mobile.

## My process

I first started with Desktop first html. I made sure the image went first before the text. Completing the html, I transition to mobile first css. I made sure the mobile component was done first because the layout was simple. Then I added media query to complete the desktop version. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Using flexbox had some drawbacks. Espeically with the image on the right being 50% of the width made the journey difficult. I had to even use a min-height to ensure the hero didn't overgrow. This made the left column stop increasing and could style no matter how big the screen size was. 

Next time using a grid may make the process simpler.
